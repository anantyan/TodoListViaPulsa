### 📌 Description
Application todo list List of people's names with Job Title and Job Description of a person, sorry in advance if it is preferred to use Flutter, because my ability is limited to Kotlin Native, which until now I am trying to find a way to complete this Test Case, but the information I get is allowed to use technology that is almost similar to Flutter (Kotlin Native) Native Apps, but I have implemented in accordance with doucment such as Clean Architecture and Clean Code and most importantly there are Unit Tests along with Test Covering Assessment Passed Test for each feature function. Maybe from me it is not suitable or the Test Case does not use Flutter but still uses Kotlin Native, I will still do my best and as appropriate as possible, thank you.
